In the folder which contains the .lib files you want to link, add a foo-config.cmake file. The contents should contain something like this:

	include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)
	get_filename_component(LOCAL_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE} PATH)

	set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIRS "${LOCAL_DIR}/foo/include;" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
	set(FOO_DEPENDS "" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
	set(FOO_DEFINITIONS "" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
	set(FOO_LIBRARIES "${LOCAL_DIR}/foo/lib/foo.lib" "${LOCAL_DIR}/foo/lib/foo-extra.lib")
	FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(FOO DEFAULT_MSG FOO_LIBRARIES FOO_INCLUDE_DIRS)
	set(FOO_PACKAGE_FOUND ${FOO_FOUND} CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)

We can duplicate this section for each library we want to link under this one configuration name.

In the CMakeLists.txt file of your actual project:

	set(foo_DIR ../foo)			# shows cmake where to find the foo package's foo-config.cmake file.

	find_package(foo REQUIRED)	# finds the 'foo' package

	qi_use_lib(project FOO)		# use the 'FOO' library created in the foo package
	qi_use_lib(project BAR)		# use the 'BAR' library created in the foo package


That should be all!
